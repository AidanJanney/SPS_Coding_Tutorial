# SPS Coding Tutorial #

Hello! This tutorial is still in progress to include more features for all of the notebooks, but there is a lot of material to dig into right now!

## Navigation
* ElasticPendulum.ipynb - Jupyter Notebook containing information and code to numerically model a pendulum on a spring. There will be more visualization and solving features implemented soon!
**Still in progress:**
* inevercode.ipynb - start here if you have never used coding languages or tried coding before!
* ineverpython.ipynb - start here if you have coded before, but you are new to Python!

## Usage
First you need a GitHub account! You can easily sign up with Google or through other sources. There are a bunch of options to get started with:
* You can clone this repository to your own computer or another computer using the github interface or the command line argument: `git clone https://github.com/AidanJanney/SPS_Coding_Tutorial.git`. 
  * If you're new to git (it can be very confusing!) try looking through different resources: [GitHub: Geting Started with Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/set-up-git)
* You can also fork the repository using the button at the top of the screen. This will create a copy that you have full access and control over, and it is now linked to your GitHub account.
* If you just want to mess around, try GitHub codespaces! You can press the green "<> Code" button at the top of the screen. Select GitHub codespaces and start a new environment. Give it a couple minutes to wind-up, and you should be good to go!
